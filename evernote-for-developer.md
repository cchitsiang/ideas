## Evernote for developer
Stumble across https://github.com/sinclairtarget/um which is quite nice, can read something from terminal (more for coder / hacker).
What um missing is where how it can sync to github or other source control providers automatically

Can combine with https://github.com/klauscfhq/taskbook and https://github.com/ZeroX-DG/CommitTasks too
